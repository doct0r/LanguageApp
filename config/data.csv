doct0r/LanguageApp; Remove auto log in when logging in with Google account;Story;High;Current behaviour: 

When you have previously logged in with Google and logged out again: the second time and all times after that when you log in with google you get automatically logged in without having to input username or password. So in the case that someone changes their google details they can't change account. Even after having reinstalled the app multiple times and deleted all app data you still log in automatically when pressing google log in.  

Desired behaviour: 

Allow users to log in again manually (entering mail and password) after having previously logged in with Google and logged out.

doct0r/LanguageApp; Move ID share functionality to profile screen;Story;Medium;"---------------------- 
Description: 
---------------------- 

Testing has shown that it would be useful to also show your AqualityID on the Group page in profile, making it easier to share the ID verbally if you create a group. 

Because of this, we are allowing the user to share and view their ID from both the profile screen and the groups profile screen.

doct0r/LanguageApp; Read & Write the parameter for intelligent flow;Story;Medium;"*Description:* 
In order to make the flow more intuitive and switch tabs based on the last used parameter, the app needs to store the parameter that was used most recently. 

Basic functionality for this feature includes reading and writing the parameter. 

1. Read the parameter (what is the current parameter) 
* Every time the user is on a screen with a tab or filter the selected parameter is read: nitrate, salinity, ammonium or phosphate. This applies for the following pages: 
** *home screen* 
** *map* 
** *tutorial* 
** *manual measurement* 

2. Write the parameter (changing the parameter) 
* Every time the user manually changes a tab or filter (on one of the applicable pages), the new parameter is stored in memory and it overwrites the previous stored parameter. This applies for the following pages: 
** *home screen* 
** *map* 
** *tutorial* 
** *manual measurement* 

3. Standard behaviour 
* If the user opens the app for the first time, the default is nitrate 
* If the user closes the app, the last selected parameter is stored, so it can be used when reopening the app 
* All of the above should remain regardless whether the user is logged in or logged out (or changing logins in the meantime)

On the manual input screen, the user has the option to switch between NO3 and NO3-N for nitrate, but there is no explanation on what it means for users who are not familiar with the difference. Therefore, we should add the info screen that we also use in the settings to explain the difference between NO3 and NO3-N. (See attached photos) 
* add the (i) icon to the pop-up where you select between NO3 and NO3-N 
* add the info screen that we also use in the settings

doct0r/LanguageApp; Refactor permission logic code for more readability within MainActivity.java;Story;Low;"""Things that pop right away: 
* function is huge (almost 100 lines) 
* the outer switch only has 1 case... so it could be an if statement... 
* there are too many nested condition statements making it quite difficult to read... 

My suggestion would be to extract parts of if to new smaller functions with meaningful names and reuse where needed. Making it simples, smaller and easier to understand."""

*Current behaviour* 

When selecting the description field of a measurement, the keyboard doesn't work when the field is not visible in the screen. 

In some cases, this can be a positive as you can't make mistakes typing blindly. In other cases, you are still not able to edit even after you can see the field, in which case you need to select another field first and then coming back to it. See the 2 attached videos."
